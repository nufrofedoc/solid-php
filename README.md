# SOLID Principles in PHP

### Single Responsibility Principle
> A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

### Open Closed Principle
> Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### Liskov Substitution Principle
> Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

### Interface Segregation Principle
> Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

### Dependency Inversion Principle
> Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions.
